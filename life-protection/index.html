<p>A level or decreasing term life insurance cover is the where most people begin their protection journey. This is a tax
free lump sum amount that will pay out if you die during the ‘term’. The main reason for this is to protect the
mortgage but can be used as legacy planning and/or </p>

<li>Critical Illness Cover</li>
<li>Critical illness cover is there to pay a tax-free lump sum to you on the diagnosis of certain and specific illnesses that each provider explains. We cannot stress enough as a company the importance of protecting yourself, the financial problems and stress that can come from not covering yourself is not worth the risk. Having a policy in place can take the financial stress off you and your family. The tax-free lump sum is generally used to pay for medical bills, care costs or daily financial commitments.</li>
</ol>
<p>This cover is usually and ‘add on’ to life assurance policies as an additional benefit but it can be a stand-alone protection plan.</p>

<h2>Income Protection</h2>
<p>Income Protection is there to pay you a monthly income should you be unable to work due to accident or sickness.
It will pay out up until the term of the policy (this can vary from 1 year all the way up to retirement age).
It is for both employed and self-employed and can help you to continue living your lifestyle despite being off work.</p>

<li>Whole of Life</li>
<li>Whole of Life simply is a policy that will pay out on the event of your death and it is guaranteed to do so. It is typically more expensive than term assurance for that reason, but is a great plan for guaranteeing something for your family on the event of your death.  It is great if you are looking to leave some money to family, future school fees, funeral costs and again inheritance tax purposes.</li>

<li>Business Protection</li>
</ol>
<p>Business protection is usually broken down into two different policies;
Key Man Assurance. Having this protection is key as there are many reasons the loss of a colleague in your business can cause serious issues in the business, things like their knowledge and skills along with loss of revenue. Having this will bring piece of mind knowing that financially you will not suffer if they are unable to work.
Relevant Life Cover. Simply this will pay a lump sum on the death of an employee, which creates a cost-effective way of covering them. These are usually aimed at small companies who do not warrant an expensive group life scheme and high earning employees with large pension funds who do not want their death in service benefit to become part of their lifetime allowance.</p>
