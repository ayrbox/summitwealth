You can access the equity in your home as tax-free cash without having to sell or downsize.\nThere’s no restrictions on how you spend your money, offering the financial freedom to make the most of your\nlater-life.</p>\n<h3>Do I have to make monthly repayments?</h3>\n<p>With the most popular type of equity release plan, a lifetime mortgage, you don’t have to make any regular monthly repayments. Instead, interest is rolled-up against the loan so that you have nothing to pay during your lifetime.\nThen when you pass away, or move into long-term care, the house is sold and the loan, including the interest,\nis paid off with any remaining money passing to your estate.</p>\n<h3>Will I retain ownership of my home?</h3>\n<p>A lifetime mortgage plan allows full home ownership. These plans are the most popular with over 55s considering\ntaking out equity release.</p>\n<p>However, homeowners who choose to take out a home reversion plan, sell a percentage or all of their home in exchange\nfor a lump sum of cash, along with the right to stay in the property, rent free for as long as they live.</p>\n<h3>Lifetime Mortgages</h3>\n<p>A Lifetime Mortgage is a mortgage secured against your home, allowing you to release a tax-free cash lump sum from\nthe equity held in your property. With a Lifetime Mortgage you retain full ownership of your home and still benefit\nfrom any increases in price.</p>\n<h3>Home Reversion Plans</h3>\n<p>A Home Reversion Plan is another type of equity release product which offers a way to sell part of your home in return for a tax-free lump sum or regular income with a\n‘lifetime lease’. A ‘lifetime lease’ ensures the individual can stay in their property until they die or go into\nlong-term care.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/equity-release","title":"Equity Release","image":{"id":"ff72239a-199e-549e-b4c9-f4d1839bb8eb","childImageSharp":{"id":"617bd1b1-acea-559b-bfb3-0bd9de3659c5","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/14b42/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg","srcSet":"/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/f836f/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg 200w,\n/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/2244e/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg 400w,\n/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/14b42/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg 800w,\n/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/47498/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg 1200w,\n/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/0e329/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg 1600w,\n/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/6a059/zlA7c39DfFk.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
