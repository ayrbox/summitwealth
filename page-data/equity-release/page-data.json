You can access the equity in your home\nas tax-free cash without having to sell or downsize. There’s no restrictions on\nhow you spend your money, offering the financial freedom to make the most of\nyour later-life.</p>\n<h4>Do I have to make monthly repayments?</h4>\n<p>With the most popular type of equity release plan, a lifetime mortgage, you\ndon’t have to make any regular monthly repayments. Instead, interest is\nrolled-up against the loan so that you have nothing to pay during your lifetime.\nThen when you pass away, or move into long-term care, the house is sold and the\nloan, including the interest, is paid off with any remaining money passing to\nyour estate.</p>\n<h4>Will I retain ownership of my home?</h4>\n<p>A lifetime mortgage plan allows full home ownership. These plans are the most\npopular with over 55s considering taking out equity release.</p>\n<p>However, homeowners who choose to take out a home reversion plan, sell a\npercentage or all of their home in exchange for a lump sum of cash, along with\nthe right to stay in the property, rent free for as long as they live.</p>\n<h4>Lifetime Mortgages</h4>\n<p>A Lifetime Mortgage is a mortgage secured against your home, allowing you to\nrelease a tax-free cash lump sum from the equity held in your property. With a\nLifetime Mortgage you retain full ownership of your home and still benefit from\nany increases in price.</p>\n<h4>Home Reversion Plans</h4>\n<p>A Home Reversion Plan is another type of equity release product which offers a\nway to sell part of your home in return for a tax-free lump sum or regular\nincome with a ‘lifetime lease’. A ‘lifetime lease’ ensures the individual can\nstay in their property until they die or go into long-term care.</p>\n<p><strong>Equity release may involve a lifetime mortgage which is secured against your\nproperty or a home reversion plan which requires the sale of property for a\ndiscounted price. To understand the features and risks, ask for a personalised\nillustration. You only continue to own your own home with a lifetime mortgage.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Equity release may impact the size of your estate and it could affect your\nentitlement to current and future means-tested benefits.</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/equity-release","title":"Equity Release","lead":"Equity Release mortgages can provide you with more freedom and a better standard of life in your later years.\n","image":{"id":"1baa0ca2-6383-5e74-80e5-6a6bca417cd9","childImageSharp":{"id":"91765d2e-7d1c-5b8a-9c44-1e215cb8fcde","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/14b42/equity-release.jpg","srcSet":"/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/f836f/equity-release.jpg 200w,\n/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/2244e/equity-release.jpg 400w,\n/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/14b42/equity-release.jpg 800w,\n/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/47498/equity-release.jpg 1200w,\n/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/0e329/equity-release.jpg 1600w,\n/summitwealth/static/59f0275c53ec7ee701fb793a26595599/6a059/equity-release.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"links":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
