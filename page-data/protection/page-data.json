This is a tax free lump sum amount that will pay out\nif you die during the ‘term’. The main reason for this is to protect the\nmortgage but can be used as legacy planning and/or inheritance tax purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We offer whole of market advice.</li>\n<li>We have access to exclusive products, rates and criteria giving us a\ncompetitive edge in the market.</li>\n<li>We offer one on one advice and can discuss all needs privately and\nprofessionally.</li>\n<li>Free consultations to all</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Critical Illness Cover</h4>\n<p>Critical illness cover is there to pay a tax-free lump sum to you on the\ndiagnosis of certain and specific illnesses that each provider explains. We\ncannot stress enough as a company the importance of protecting yourself, the\nfinancial problems and stress that can come from not covering yourself is not\nworth the risk. Having a policy in place can take the financial stress off you\nand your family. The tax-free lump sum is generally used to pay for medical\nbills, care costs or daily financial commitments. Critical illness cover may\nalso be included in the policy or can be added extra. Policies may cover your\nnatural, step and adopted children.</p>\n<p>This cover is usually an ‘add on’ to life assurance policies as an additional\nbenefit but it can be a stand-alone protection plan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We offer whole of market advice.</li>\n<li>We have access to exclusive products, rates and criteria giving us a\ncompetitive edge in the market.</li>\n<li>We offer one on one advice and can discuss all needs privately and\nprofessionally.</li>\n<li>Free consultations to all</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Income Protection</h4>\n<p>Income Protection is there to pay you a monthly income should you be unable to\nwork due to an accident or sickness. It will pay out up until the term of the\npolicy (this can vary from 1 year all the way up to retirement age). It is for\nboth employed and self-employed workers and can help you to continue living your\nlifestyle despite being off work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We offer whole of market advice.</li>\n<li>We have access to exclusive products, rates and criteria giving us a\ncompetitive edge in the market.</li>\n<li>We offer one on one advice and can discuss all needs privately and\nprofessionally.</li>\n<li>Free consultations to all</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Family Income Benefit</h4>\n<p>Family income benefit is a type of life insurance that provides a regular income\nfor your loved ones if you die during the term of the plan. A family income\nbenefit policy will pay out a monthly tax-free income if you die during the\nterm, until the policy ends. Household bills and other financial commitments\nneed to be met and a loss of income could mean financial hardship.</p>\n<h4>Whole of Life</h4>\n<p>Whole of Life simply is a policy that will pay out on the event of your death\nand it is guaranteed to do so. It is typically more expensive than term\nassurance for that reason, but is a great plan for guaranteeing something for\nyour family on the event of your death.  It is great if you are looking to leave\nsome money to family, future school fees, funeral costs and again inheritance\ntax purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We offer whole of market advice.</li>\n<li>We have access to exclusive products, rates and criteria giving us a\ncompetitive edge in the market.</li>\n<li>We offer one on one advice and can discuss all needs privately and\nprofessionally.</li>\n<li>Free consultations to all</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Business Protection</h4>\n<p>Business protection is usually broken down into two different policies;</p>\n<p><strong>Key Man Assurance</strong>. Having this protection is key as there are many reasons\nthe loss of a colleague in your business can cause serious issues in the\nbusiness, things like their knowledge and skills along with loss of revenue.\nHaving this will bring piece of mind knowing that financially you will not\nsuffer if they are unable to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Relevant Life Cover</strong>. Simply this will pay a lump sum on the death of an\nemployee, which creates a cost-effective way of covering them. These are usually\naimed at small companies who do not warrant an expensive group life scheme and\nhigh earning employees with large pension funds who do not want their death in\nservice benefit to become part of their lifetime allowance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We offer whole of market advice.</li>\n<li>We have access to exclusive products, rates and criteria giving us a\ncompetitive edge in the market.</li>\n<li>We offer one on one advice and can discuss all needs privately and\nprofessionally.</li>\n<li>Free consultations to all</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/protection","title":"Protection","lead":"You’ve settled into a new life in a new house, but what if anything bad happens?
