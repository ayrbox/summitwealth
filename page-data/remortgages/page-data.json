Remortgage can be used for\nvarious reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch to a better rate meaning lower monthly payments.</li>\n<li>Release money in order to consolidate debts, improve your property, buy another property, tax reasons or business reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is worth noting that a remortgage is not the best option in all cases. Even though you may switch to a lower\ninterest rate the new lender may charge a valuation and solicitor fees as well as an early repayment charge to exit\nthe mortgage. Therefore, you may be able to switch your current mortgage deal with your current lender.
