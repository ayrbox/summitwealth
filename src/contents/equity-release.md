### What Is Equity Release?

If you're over 55 years old, you will have a range of different choices available to suit
your borrowing needs. You can access the equity in your home as tax-free cash without having to sell or downsize.
There’s no restrictions on how you spend your money, offering the financial freedom to make the most of your
later-life.

### Do I have to make monthly repayments?

With the most popular type of equity release plan, a lifetime mortgage, you don’t have to make any regular monthly repayments. Instead, interest is rolled-up against the loan so that you have nothing to pay during your lifetime.
Then when you pass away, or move into long-term care, the house is sold and the loan, including the interest,
is paid off with any remaining money passing to your estate.

### Will I retain ownership of my home?

A lifetime mortgage plan allows full home ownership. These plans are the most popular with over 55s considering
taking out equity release.

However, homeowners who choose to take out a home reversion plan, sell a percentage or all of their home in exchange
for a lump sum of cash, along with the right to stay in the property, rent free for as long as they live.

### Lifetime Mortgages

A Lifetime Mortgage is a mortgage secured against your home, allowing you to release a tax-free cash lump sum from
the equity held in your property. With a Lifetime Mortgage you retain full ownership of your home and still benefit
from any increases in price.

### Home Reversion Plans

A Home Reversion Plan is another type of equity release product which offers a way to sell part of your home in return for a tax-free lump sum or regular income with a
‘lifetime lease’. A ‘lifetime lease’ ensures the individual can stay in their property until they die or go into
long-term care.
