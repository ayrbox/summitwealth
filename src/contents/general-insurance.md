## Buildings and Contents Insurance

Buildings insurance covers the cost of repairing damage to the structure of your property. Garages, sheds and fences
are covered, as well as fixtures and fittings. Buildings insurance usually covers loss or damage caused by fire,
explosion, storms, floods, earthquakes. This is typically a condition of your mortgage, so not having a policy in
place could put your mortgage, and your home, at risk.

Contents insurance simply covers the contents inside your home, things you have decided to disclose as more expensive
items can be added to this along with just a general amount of contents inside your property, things consisting of
jewellery, TVs, bikes and art among other things. There are other ‘bolt ons’ that can be added that can be tailored to
your needs.

This can also be tailored to your specific wants and needs of what you would like to have protected. It can consist of multiple properties on one blanket policy or if you just have the one property on its own then we can cover that also.
