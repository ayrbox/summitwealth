      Making a Will is the only way to ensure that your wishes are carried out after your death.
      ​Many people put off making a Will, no one wants to think about dying, but leaving it too late can have a major impact
      on your family and loved ones.

    <p>
      Conveyancing is the legal transfer of a property from one owner to another. The process involves a
      conveyancing solicitor or licensed conveyancer who acts on behalf of the buyer to ensure their client receives the
      title deeds to the property and the land it sits on. Conveyancing covers the entirety of the legal and administrative
      work required to ensure a house purchase is valid under law.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t already have a solicitor in mind, we recommend using one from our preferred panel. Please get in touch
      with us to discuss in detail.

    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Surveys & Valuations</h4>
    <p>
      A house survey is carried out by a qualified surveyor who
      checks the condition of a home before you buy.  In the same way you might get a car checked over before you buy it,
      it’s a good idea to find out more about the property you are looking to invest in. There are 3 types of types of
      survey available;
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Level 1 – Valuation</li>
        <li>Level 2 – Survey and Valuation</li>
        <li>Level 3 – Full Building Survey</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please speak to us to find out which type of survey is right for you.</p>
