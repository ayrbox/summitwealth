#### Who are we?

We are Summit Wealth Ltd and appointed representative of New Leaf Distribution
Ltd.

Summit Wealth Ltd provide financial planning solutions and advice through
experienced and qualified advisers based in the UK. Currently Summit Wealth Ltd
and New Leaf Distribution jointly determine the purposes and means of processing
personal client data relating to giving advice. This means we are joint data
controllers for these core advice giving activities and therefore responsible
for managing this client data and ensuring compliance. However, Summit Wealth
Ltd is solely responsible for some activities, for example any direct marketing
that we undertake.

#### What is this privacy statement about?

To supply our customers with our services we need to use information about you,
and some of that may be personal or private. For example we may need to know
your name and address, details of how you would like to be contacted (e.g. your
mobile phone number), or how you would like to pay for the services we provide
you.

As we do this, we’d like you to take some time to read this privacy statement.
It will explain what information we might collect about you, why we collect it,
what we may use it for, and who we may give it to. We’ll also explain your
rights towards your information and how we look after it while we have it.

#### What information do we collect about you?

The information we collect about you may vary based on what service we provide
to you. Typically, we need details like:

- Your name and address so we know who you are and what services you need from
  us
- Your contact details like phone number or email so that we can keep in touch
  with you about our services.
- Your bank account or other financial details so we can manage your payment for
  our services.

If you are receiving some financial services advice, we will need to know more
information about your current position. This might include information
regarding:

- Your employment information
- Your assets and liabilities

Some financial services products may require us to collect information about
your health and lifestyle.

We only collect information about you that we need to make sure you get the best
service from us. We respect your privacy and we try to minimise what we do
collect.

#### How do we collect information about you?

We prefer to collect the information we need directly from you. That way, you
know what we have, and we can be sure you’ve provided us with the most accurate
and up to date information.

We will usually do this:

- When you complete our fact find and discussion document.
- When you contact us for any reason.
- If you complete an online form.
- If you interact with us through the client portal.
- If you complete a survey.
- When completing application forms.

#### What do we do with the information we collect about you?

We use your information in various ways, such as to:

- Meet the purposes that you provided your information for
- Provide you with the services you want
- Let you know about goods or services we feel would be beneficial to you.
- Prevent fraud, money laundering and financial crime
- To confirm your identity.
- Credit scoring and assessment, and credit management (where applicable).
- Keep our records accurate and up to date.
- Comply with any legal or regulatory obligations we may have.

#### Who do we share your information with?

We appreciate that you have provided your information to us and may not want us
to share it with other people or organisations, however sometimes it is
necessary for us to do so.

We only share your information where we are permitted or required to by law, or
where you have requested us to do so. We may share your information with, for
example:

- Any of your family, associates, or someone who represents you, where you have
  asked us to do so.
- Our employees who provide you with our services.
- Carefully selected organisations and specialists to help us provide you with
  our services.
- Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies in order to help prevent and
  detect fraud as part of our due diligence process.
- Any person, organisation or regulator where we are required to because of a
  court order, regulatory responsibility, legal duty or statutory obligation.

We are careful to minimise such sharing.

Although we are a UK company, we may sometimes share your information with an
organisation who is outside the UK. Such companies may also be outside of
Europe. We may do this, but we will only do so where we are permitted to by law.

Whenever we share your information we do everything we can to make sure it is
protected from misuse or loss.

#### How do we look after and secure your information

When we use information about you we take all reasonable efforts to do so fairly
and lawfully.

We think it likely that our customers know we use information about them, and we
provide notices of such wherever we can.

We never use information about you unless it is lawful for us to do so and we
have a clearly defined need or purpose.

When we collect information about you we ensure that we minimise what we
collect. We try not to keep your information for longer than we need it and we
ensure that the records we have about you are managed properly and deleted
promptly and securely when we no longer need them.

We make every effort to ensure your rights towards your information, which we
detail below.

We take appropriate care to secure the information we hold about you. We have
robust technical security such as passwords and information encryption. We also
have policies and procedures to ensure your information is only available to our
employees who need to see it to do their job, and we train those employees
appropriately.

Also, we establish robust procedures and contracts to extend these protections
to any other person or organisation we may need to give your information to.

In everything we do with your information we try to be fair, lawful, and open,
and we take seriously our obligations towards your privacy and the protection of
information we may hold about you.

#### By email and phone

If you have contacted us by email, or provided an email address, we may use that
to contact you if we need to.

You should also be aware that information conveyed by email could be
deliberately or accidentally intercepted or corrupted.

Whilst we make every effort to ensure that emails we send to you are free from
viruses this cannot be guaranteed. We recommend that you scan all email for
viruses with appropriate and frequently updated virus checking software. You
should also avoid sending us emails from unsecure or public wi-fi zones (such as

Where you are receiving financial advice, we encourage you to use our client

financial advisor. A guide to using the client portal is available for download

we can keep this information up to date.

#### Your rights

GDPR gives you certain rights towards your personal information. We take all
reasonable efforts to ensure we allow you to exercise those rights.

You have the right to see all the personal information we hold about you.

We’ll handle routine enquiries as part of our usual customer service. If you
want to see more of the information that we have about you, you can make a data
subject access request.

You can write to our principal at: Privacy Officer, New Leaf Distribution, 1st

us, or we are acting to comply with a legal obligation or in a life or death
situation, you can object to us using your personal information in a way that
causes you ‘substantial and unwarranted damage or distress’.

Damage means that we will use or have used your information in a way that caused
you some loss or harm which we shouldn’t have.

Distress means that we will use or have used your information in a way that
caused you some upset or anguish which was more than an annoyance.

You can write to us and ask us to stop using your information in that way. We
will respond within 21 days.

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information we have about you is
accurate and up to date.

soon as possible and we will ensure it is corrected.

keep you notified of products and services that we feel might be beneficial to
you as part of our ongoing service to you. This could extend to contacting you
in advance of a product deal expiring or to keep in touch for a yearly review.
