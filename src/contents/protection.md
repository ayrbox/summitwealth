    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Life Assurance</h4>
    <p>
      A level or decreasing term life insurance cover is the where most people begin
      their protection journey. This is a tax free lump sum amount that will pay out
      if you die during the ‘term’. The main reason for this is to protect the
      mortgage but can be used as legacy planning and/or inheritance tax purposes.

    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Critical Illness Cover</h4>
    <p>Critical illness cover is there to pay a tax-free lump sum to you on the
diagnosis of certain and specific illnesses that each provider explains. We
cannot stress enough as a company the importance of protecting yourself, the
financial problems and stress that can come from not covering yourself is not
worth the risk. Having a policy in place can take the financial stress off you
and your family. The tax-free lump sum is generally used to pay for medical
bills, care costs or daily financial commitments. Critical illness cover may
also be included in the policy or can be added extra. Policies may cover your
natural, step and adopted children.</p>
<p>This cover is usually an ‘add on’ to life assurance policies as an additional
benefit but it can be a stand-alone protection plan.</p>

    <p>Income Protection is there to pay you a monthly income should you be unable to
work due to an accident or sickness. It will pay out up until the term of the
policy (this can vary from 1 year all the way up to retirement age). It is for
both employed and self-employed workers and can help you to continue living your
lifestyle despite being off work.</p>

    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Family Income Benefit</h4>
    <p>
   Family income benefit is a type of life insurance that provides a regular income
for your loved ones if you die during the term of the plan. A family income
benefit policy will pay out a monthly tax-free income if you die during the
term, until the policy ends. Household bills and other financial commitments
need to be met and a loss of income could mean financial hardship.

    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Whole of Life</h4>
    <p>
    Whole of Life simply is a policy that will pay out on the event of your death
and it is guaranteed to do so. It is typically more expensive than term
assurance for that reason, but is a great plan for guaranteeing something for
your family on the event of your death. It is great if you are looking to leave
some money to family, future school fees, funeral costs and again inheritance
tax purposes.

    <h4 class="featurette-heading">Business Protection</h4>
<p>Business protection is usually broken down into two different policies;</p>
<p><strong>Key Man Assurance</strong>. Having this protection is key as there are many reasons
the loss of a colleague in your business can cause serious issues in the
business, things like their knowledge and skills along with loss of revenue.
Having this will bring piece of mind knowing that financially you will not
suffer if they are unable to work.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Life Cover</strong>. Simply this will pay a lump sum on the death of an
employee, which creates a cost-effective way of covering them. These are usually
aimed at small companies who do not warrant an expensive group life scheme and
high earning employees with large pension funds who do not want their death in
service benefit to become part of their lifetime allowance.</p>
