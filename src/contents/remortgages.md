We make it easy for you to remortgage, ensuring you never pay any more than you need to. Remortgage can be used for
various reasons:

- Switch to a better rate meaning lower monthly payments.
- Release money in order to consolidate debts, improve your property, buy another property, tax reasons or business reasons.

It is worth noting that a remortgage is not the best option in all cases. Even though you may switch to a lower
interest rate the new lender may charge a valuation and solicitor fees as well as an early repayment charge to exit
the mortgage. Therefore, you may be able to switch your current mortgage deal with your current lender. This is where
Summit Wealth’s experience will be able to guide you in the best direction.
